However, <START:protein> N protein <END> was found to interact with <START:protein> CyPA <END>.
The result showed that <START:protein> AP-9 <END> was bound to the detected cells.
By use of the immunofluo escence double-staining  method, both <START:protein> HAb18G/CD147 <END> and <START:protein> AP-9 V <END> were seen on the same binding sites (the cell membrane and the cyto-plasm)  of SARS-CoV infected 293 cells (figu e 3C).
<START:protein> AP-9 <END> was shown to be bound to the detected cells, at the binding rate of 98.15% (figure 2B), which was very close to the expression  rate of <START:protein> HAb18G/CD147 <END> on the same kind of cells.
The percentages of cells undergoing cell division increased to 31 36% among GFP-positive cells when pEGFP-N were co-expressed with <START:protein> SUMO-1 <END>.
Since both human <START:protein> hnRNP A1 <END> and SARS_N proteins bind to RNA and implement  their functions in RNA replication and transcription [11], we thus tentatively proposed that, together with the bound RNA, SARS_N might probably interact with the hu-H.
The distribution of <START:protein> myeloid lineage-associated cytokine receptors <END> and <START:protein> lysosomal proteins <END> was analyzed in human CD34+ cord blood cell (CB) subsets at different stages of myeloid commitment by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
<START:protein> AP-1 alpha (Fos/Jun) transcription factors <END> in hematopoietic differentiation and apoptosis.
A combination of in vitro and in vivo molecular genetic approaches have provided evidence to suggest that <START:protein> AP-1 (Fos/Jun) transcription factors <END> play multiple roles in functional development of hematopoietic precursor cells into mature blood cells along most, if not all, of the hematopoietic cell lineages.
In addition, studies using <START:protein> c-Fos <END> knockout mice have established a unique role for <START:protein> Fos <END>, as a member of <START:protein> the AP-1 transcription factor complex <END>, in determining the differentiation and activity of progenitors of the osteoclast lineage, a population of bone-forming cells which are of hematopoietic origin as well.
Inhibition of <START:protein> Bcl-xL <END> would lead to activation and translocation of <START:protein> BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins <END> and multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins from cytosol to mitochondria and trigger cytochrome c release and activation of caspase cascade [15,47].
An equal amount of <START:protein> V-ATPase G1 TRX fusion protein <END> and the SARS-CoV <START:protein> 3CLpro <END> was first incubated with anti-TRX mAb at 4  C overnight, followed by incubation with the protein <START:protein> A-Sepharose <END> beads for the addition of 2-h incubation.
Mutagenesis experiments showed that the <START:protein> transmembrane domain of 7a <END> is essential for both apoptosis induction and interaction with <START:protein> Bcl-XL <END> (Fig. 3), suggesting that <START:protein> 7a <END> induces apoptosis via its interaction with <START:protein> Bcl-XL beta <END>.
In addition, these mutations decreased the ability of <START:protein> PU.1 <END> to synergize with <START:protein> PU.1-interacting proteins <END> such as <START:protein> AML1 <END> or <START:protein> c-Jun <END> in the activation of <START:protein> PU.1 target genes <END>.
The 48S complex accumulated in the presence of <START:protein> GMP-PNP I xx <END>, but not in the presence of hippuristanol (Fig. 3c).
