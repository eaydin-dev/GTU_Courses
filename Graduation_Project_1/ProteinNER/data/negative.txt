B, Immu-nofluorescence  double-labeling method in <START:protein> SARS-CoV <END> infected 293 cells.
Elucidation of the <START:protein> molecular <END> mechanism for <START:protein> lymphocyte apoptosis <END> induced by SARS-encoded proteins may lead to the development of SARS-CoV E-peptide-based inhibitors that will specifically prevent apoptosis in <START:protein> T-cells <END> and enhance anti-SARS-CoV T-cell immunity.
Fos/Jun have been implicated as positive modulators of apoptosis induced in <START:protein> hematopoietic progenitor cells <END> of the <START:protein> myeloid lineage <END>, a function that may relate to the control of blood cell homeostasis, as well as in programmed cell death associated with terminal differentiation of many other cell types, and apoptosis associated with withdrawal of growth/survival factors.
In addition, studies using c-Fos knockout mice have established a unique role for Fos, as a member of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, in determining the differentiation and activity of progenitors of the <START:protein> osteoclast lineage <END>, a population of <START:protein> bone-forming cells <END> which are of hematopoietic origin as well.
Therefore, these ten identified <START:protein> phage clones <END> were suggested to display the high affinity of lung <START:protein> cDNA <END> clones to SARS-CoV 3CLpro.
The relevance to <START:protein> SARS-CoV pathogenesis <END> be-comes  an attractive issue for developing anti-SARS therapy.
As deduced from an analysis of the three-dimensional  structure of Bcl-XL, these residues are involved in <START:protein> hydrophobic <END> interactions with the <START:protein> BH3 domains <END> of death agonists but are not involved in intramolecular interactions (21).
