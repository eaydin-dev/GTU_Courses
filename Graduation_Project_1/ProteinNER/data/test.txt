The 48S complex accumulated in the presence of GMP-PnP I xx, but not in the presence of hippuristanol (Fig. 3c).
The percentages of cells undergoing cell division increased to 31 36% among GFP-positive cells when pEGFP-N were co-expressed with SUMO-4 receptor.
Fos/Jun have been implicated as positive modulators of apoptosis induced in hematopoietic progenitor cells alpha hghhg of the myeloid lineage, a function that may relate to the control of blood cell homeostasis, as well as in programmed cell death associated with terminal differentiation of many other cell types, and apoptosis associated with withdrawal of growth/survival factors.
